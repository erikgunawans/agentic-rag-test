## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-04-25)

**Core value:** Indonesian legal teams can manage the full contract lifecycle with confidence that AI outputs are accurate, citable, and traceable.
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.0 — PII Redaction System (chat-time anonymization, no real PII to cloud LLMs).

## Current Position

- **Phase:** Phase 1: Detection & Anonymization Foundation (defined, not started)
- **Plan:** —
- **Status:** Roadmap defined; awaiting `/gsd-discuss-phase 1`
- **Last activity:** 2026-04-25 — Milestone v1.0 roadmap derived: 6 phases, 54 / 54 v1.0 REQ-IDs mapped (`gsd-roadmapper`)

## Accumulated Context

- Codebase map at `.planning/codebase/` (refreshed 2026-04-25, commit `f1a8c62`)
- 38 validated requirements baselined in `REQUIREMENTS.md` (commit `f36b9da`)
- 54 v1.0 requirements added to `REQUIREMENTS.md` (commit `aa1ad88`); milestone v1.0 PII Redaction System started commit `1fd9e49`
- v1.0 roadmap (this update): 6 phases derived from 54 REQ-IDs — see `ROADMAP.md` "Active Phases"
  - Phase 1: Detection & Anonymization Foundation (13 REQ-IDs)
  - Phase 2: Conversation-Scoped Registry & Round-Trip (8 REQ-IDs)
  - Phase 3: Entity Resolution & LLM Provider Configuration (11 REQ-IDs)
  - Phase 4: Fuzzy De-anonymization, Missed-PII Scan & Prompt Guidance (9 REQ-IDs)
  - Phase 5: Chat-Loop Integration (Buffering, SSE Status, Tool/Sub-Agent Coverage) (7 REQ-IDs)
  - Phase 6: Embedding Provider & Production Hardening (6 REQ-IDs)
- Knowledge graph at `graphify-out/` (1,211 nodes, 192 communities; god-nodes: `HybridRetrievalService`, `ToolService`)
- Workflow config: `granularity=standard`, `parallel=true`, `model_profile=balanced`, `research=skip`, `plan_check=on`, `verifier=on`
- Active deployments: Frontend on Vercel (`main` branch), Backend on Railway, Supabase project `qedhulpfezucnfadlfiz`

## Pending Items

- **Phase 1 discussion** — run `/gsd-discuss-phase 1` to refine Phase 1 (Detection & Anonymization Foundation) before planning
- **Uncommitted local files** — multiple untracked working-tree files (PRD docs, SVG assets, `graphify-out/` snapshots, `AGENTS.md`); not blocking the milestone but warrants triage before phase 1 execution
- **Pre-existing lint** — 6 ESLint errors in `frontend/src/pages/DocumentsPage.tsx` (`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`); pre-existing, not introduced by recent work
- **Embedding-provider deviation from PRD §3.2** — `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=local|cloud` decision logged in PROJECT.md "Key Decisions"; Phase 6 must respect this and document the tradeoff

## Blockers
